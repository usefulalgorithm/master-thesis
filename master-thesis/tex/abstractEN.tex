Recursion can complicate program analysis significantly.
Some program analyzers simply ignore recursion or even refuse to check recursive
programs.
In this paper, we propose an algorithm that uses a recursion-free program
analyzer as a black box to check recursive programs.
With extended program constructs for assumptions, assertions, and
non-deterministic values,
our algorithm computes function summaries from inductive invariants computed by
the underlying program analyzer.
Such function summaries enable our algorithm to check recursive programs.
We implement a prototype named \textsc{CPArec} using the recursion-free program
analyzer \textsc{CPAchecker}.
Under the comparison with other program analyzers on the benchmarks in the 2014
and 2015 Competitions on Software Verification,
our tool shows competitive efficiency and effectiveness on verifying programs
with recursion.
