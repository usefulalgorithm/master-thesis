\chapter{Acknowledgements}
I should like to thank Prof. Yu-Fang Chen and Prof. Bow-Yaw Wang at Formal
Methods Laboratory in Academia Sinica.
Your guidance and instructions helped me gradually develop the whole framework
since I was a full-time research assistant in FM Lab.
Your solid training and teaching also forced me to establish my knowledge of
Software Verification and Formal Methods.
In particular, the opportunity and the experience you gave me to attend
international conferences surely is very enlightening though quite frightening.
In addition, I am specially grateful to and surprised by the assistance from
Dr. Ming-Hsien Tsai on the implementation.
Your efficiency and proficiency on software programming skills are simply
remarkable and incomparable.
Without your assistance, I am sure I cannot finish the implementation on my own,
let alone participating the competition.

I also learned a lot and pretty enjoyed my life in Software Testing Laboratory
in National Taiwan University.
Prof. Farn Wang is a great role model as a academic researcher.
His ambition on building an industrial strength software testing tool is
respectable.
The laboratory members and assistants are just adorable.
You guys inspired me in a unique way.
Even when we were both struggling for homeworks, reports, exams, and finally
the graduation, you guys still found many ways to relax and relief the tension
among the whole lab.
"Work Hard, Play Hard" is the spirit I learned from you.
You guys rock.

Finally, my appreciation to my parents and siblings is beyond words.
Thanks for your constant nagging on me about my physically and mentally
unhealthy lifestyle as well as trying to stop my 26-year-without-girlfriend
achievement.
Your concerns and considerations kept reminding me that,
even if I might fail so hard and be so frustrated, I still can go home,
where I can relax and recover until the next challenge comes.
