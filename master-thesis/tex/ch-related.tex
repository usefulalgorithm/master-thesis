Numerous intraprocedural analysis techniques have been developed over the years.
Many tools are in fact freely available (see, for instance,
\textsc{Blast}~\cite{BeyerHJM07}, \textsc{CPAchecker}~\cite{BeyerK11}, and
\textsc{UFO}~\cite{AlbarghouthiLGC12}).
Interprocedural analysis techniques are also available (see~\cite{RepsHS95,
BallR01,CousotCFMMMR05,CuoqKKPSY12,coverity,polyspace} for a partial list).
Recently, recursive analysis attracts new attention.
The Competition on Software Verification adds a new category for recursive
programs in 2014~\cite{svcomp14}.
Among the participants, \textsc{CBMC}~\cite{ClarkeKL04},
\textsc{Ultimate Automizer}~\cite{HeizmannCDEHLNSP13}, and
\textsc{Ultimiate Kojak}~\cite{ErmisNDHP14} are the top three tools for the
\textbf{recursive} category.

Inspired by \textsc{Whale}~\cite{AlbarghouthiGC12}, we use inductive invariants
obtained from verifying under-approximation as candidates of summaries.
Also, similar to \textsc{Whale}, we apply a Hoare logic proof rule for recursive
calls from~\cite{Oheimb99}.
However, our technique works on control flow graphs and builds on an
intraprocedural analysis tool.
It is hence very lightweight and modular.
Better intraprocedural analysis tools easily give better recursive analysis
through our technique.
\textsc{Whale}, on the other hand, analyzes by exploring abstract reachability
graphs.
Since \textsc{Whale} extends summary computation and covering relations for
recursion, its implementation is more involved.

Aside from recursion analysis, using program transformation to reduce program
features is not a new concept.
We learned this concept particularly from~\cite{LalR08,LalR09},
where a program transformation technique for checking context-bounded concurrent
programs to sequential analysis is developed.
