\section{Program Model}\label{sec:model}

We consider a variant of the WHILE language from~\cite[Sec. 1.2]{NielsonHC99}:
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{array}{rccll}
    \mathtt{Expression} & \ni p & ::= &
    \mathtt{x} & \mathtt{x} \in \mathtt{Vars}\\
    & & \mid &
    \FF\ \mid\ \TT\ \mid\
    \mathtt{0}\ \mid\ \mathtt{1}\ \mid\ \ldots\hspace{5mm} &
    \textmd{constant}\\
    & & \mid &
    \mathtt{nondet} & \textmd{nondeterministic value}\\
    & & \mid &
    \fun{f}(\overline{p}) &
    \textmd{function invocation}\\
    & & \mid &
    p \odot p  & \odot \in \{ +, -, =, >, \mathtt{and}, \mathtt{or} \}\\
    & & \mid & \mathtt{not}\ p\\
    \mathtt{Command} & \ni c & ::= &
    \overline{\mathtt{x}} := \overline{p}
    & \textmd{assignment}\\
    & & \mid &
    c\mathtt{;}\ c &
    \textmd{sequential composition}\\
    & & \mid &
    \mathtt{return}\ \overline{p} & \textmd{function return}\\
    & & \mid &
    \mathtt{assume}\ p & \textmd{assumption}\\
    & & \mid &
    \mathtt{assert}\ p & \textmd{assertion}
  \end{array}
\end{equation*}
$\mathtt{Vars}$ denotes the set of \emph{program variables}, and
$\mathtt{Vars}' = \{ \mathtt{x}' : \mathtt{x} \in \mathtt{Vars} \}$
where $\mathtt{x}'$ represents the new value of $\mathtt{x}$ after
execution of a command.
%Let $t_i$ denote the $i$-th element in the sequence $\overline{t}$.
The $\mathtt{nondet}$ expression evaluates to a type-safe
nondeterministic value.
Simultaneous assignments are allowed in our language. To
execute a simultaneous assignment, all expressions on the right hand
side are first evaluated and then assigned to respective variables.
We assume that simultaneous assignments are type-safe in the sense that the
number of variables on the left-hand-side always matches that of the
right-hand-side.
The $\mathtt{return}$ command accepts several expressions as arguments.
Together with simultaneous assignments, functions can have several
return values.

\todo[inline]{Set restrictions on CFG to prevent arbitrary edges on graph
since the behavior may be undefined.}

A program \prog{P} is simply a set of functions.
Each function $\fun{f}$ in the program \prog{P} is represented as a
\emph{control flow graph (CFG)} $G^{\fun{f}} = \langle V, E, \cmd{cmd}^{\fun{f}},
\overline{\mathtt{u}}^{\fun{f}}, \overline{\mathtt{r}}^{\fun{f}}, s, e \rangle$
where the nodes in $V$ are \emph{program locations}, $E \subseteq V \times V$
are \emph{edges},
each edge $(\ell, \ell') \in E$ is labeled by the command $\cmd{cmd}^{\fun{f}}
(\ell, \ell')$,
$\overline{\mathtt{u}}^{\fun{f}}$ and $\overline{\mathtt{r}}^{\fun{f}}$ are
\emph{formal parameters} and \emph{return variables} of $\fun{f}$,
and $s,  e \in V$ are the \emph{entry} and \emph{exit} locations of $\fun{f}$.
The superscript in $G^{\fun{f}}$ denotes the CFG corresponds to the function
$\fun{f}$.
The special $\fun{main}$ function specifies where a program starts.
To simplify presentation, we assume the functions in a program use disjoint sets
of variables and the values of formal parameters never change in a function.
Notice that this will not affect the expressiveness of a CFG because one can
still make copies of formal parameters by assignments and change the values of
the copied versions.
Also we assume that there are no global variables because they can be simulated
by allowing simultaneous assignment to return variables~\cite{BallR00}.

Figure~\ref{figure:mccarthy91} shows control flow graphs for the
McCarthy 91 program from~\cite{MannaP70}. The $\fun{main}$ function assumes the
variable $\mathtt{n}$ is non-negative.
It then checks if the result of $\mathtt{mc91(n)}$ is no less than 90
(Figure~\ref{figure:mccarthy91:main}).
The $\fun{mc91}$ function branches on whether the variable $\mathtt{m}$ is
greater than 100.
If so, it returns $\mathtt{m} - 10$.
Otherwise, $\mathtt{mc91(m)}$ stores the result of $\mathtt{mc91(m + 11)}$
in $\mathtt{s}$,
and returns the result of $\mathtt{mc91(s)}$
(Figure~\ref{figure:mccarthy91:mc91}).
Observe that a conditional branch is modeled with the $\mathtt{assume}$ command
in the figure. Loops can be modeled similarly.

\todo[inline]{Extend the definition of inductive invariants to support
interprocedural analysis}
% \section{Inductive Invariants}\label{sec:semantics}

Let $G^{\fun{f}} = \langle V, E ,\cmd{cmd}^{\fun{f}},
\overline{\mathtt{u}}^{\fun{f}}, \overline{\mathtt{r}}^{\fun{f}},  s,
e \rangle$ be a CFG.
An \emph{inductive invariant} $\Pi (G^{\fun{f}},I_0) = \{ I_\ell : \ell \in V \}$
for $G^{\fun{f}}$ from $I_0$ is a set of first-order logic formulae such that
$I_s = I_0$, and for every $(\ell, \ell') \in E$
\begin{equation*}
I_{\ell} \wedge \tau_{\cmd{cmd}^\fun{f}(\ell, \ell')} \implies I'_{\ell'}
\end{equation*}
where $I'$ is obtained by replacing every $\mathtt{x} \in \mathtt{Vars}$ in $I$
with $\mathtt{x}' \in \mathtt{Vars}'$,
and $\tau_{\cmd{cmd}^\fun{f} (\ell, \ell')}$ specifies the semantics of the
command $\cmd{cmd}^\fun{f} (\ell, \ell')$.
An inductive invariant $\Pi (G^{\fun{f}}, I_0)$ is an over-approximation to the
computation of $G^{\fun{f}}$ from $I_0$.
More precisely, assume that the function ${\fun{f}}$ starts from a state
satisfying $I_0$.
For every $\ell\in V$, $G^{\fun{f}}$ must arrive in a state satisfying
$I_{\ell}$ when the computation reaches $\ell$.

\todo[inline]{More about operational semantics?}

\section{Hoare Logic and Program Analysis}\label{sec:analysis}

Let $T$ be a program fragment (it can be either a function represented as a CFG
or a sequence of program commands).
$P$ and $Q$ are logic formulae.
A \emph{Hoare triple} $\assert{P} T \assert{Q}$ specifies that the program
fragment $T$ will reach a program state satisfying $Q$ provided that $T$ starts
with a program state satisfying $P$ and terminates.
The formula $P$ is called the \emph{precondition} and $Q$ is the
\emph{postcondition} of the Hoare triple.
For intraprocedural commands, we extend the standard proof rules for partial
correctness in~\cite[Sec. 9.2]{NielsonN07} with two additional rules for the
assumption and assertion commands:
\begin{center}
  \AxiomC{}
  \LeftLabel{Assume}
  \UnaryInfC{$\assert{P}\ \mathtt{assume\ } q\
    \assert{P \wedge q}$}
  \DisplayProof
  ~
  \AxiomC{$P \implies q$}
  \LeftLabel{Assert}
  \UnaryInfC{$\assert{P}\ \mathtt{assert\ } q\  \assert{P}$}
  \DisplayProof
\end{center}
The $\mathtt{assume}$ command excludes all computation not satisfying the given
expression.
The $\mathtt{assert}$ command aborts the computation if the given expression is
not implied by the precondition.
No postcondition can be guaranteed in such a case.
For interprocedural analysis, we adopt the proof rules from~\cite{Oheimb99} for
(recursive) function calls.
In addition, there are other rules, e.g., the rules for unconditional
jumps~\cite{TanA06}.
However, those proof rules are not involved in our proof for correctness,
we consider them to be out of scope.

%For instance, the following command always terminates normally:
%\begin{equation*}
% \mathtt{assume\ false};\ \ \mathtt{assert\ false}
%\end{equation*}
Observe that an inductive invariant $\Pi (G^{\fun{f}}, I_0)$ establishes
$\assert{I_0} G^{\fun{f}} \assert{I_{e}}$.
A \emph{program analyzer} accepts programs as inputs and checks if all
assertions (specified by the $\mathtt{assert}$ command) are satisfied.
One way to implement program analyzers is to compute inductive invariants.
\begin{proposition}
Let $G^{\fun{f}} = \langle V, E,\cmd{cmd}^{\fun{f}},
\overline{\mathtt{u}}^{\fun{f}}, \overline{\mathtt{r}}^{\fun{f}}, s, e \rangle$
be a CFG and $\Pi (G^{\fun{f}}, \TT)$ be an inductive invariant for
$G^{\fun{f}}$ from $\TT$.
If $\models I_{\ell} \implies B_{\ell}$ for every edge $(\ell, \ell') \in E$
with $\cmd{cmd} (\ell, \ell') = \mathtt{assert} (B_{\ell})$,
then all assertions in $G^{\fun{f}}$ are satisfied.
\label{proposition:inductive-invariant}
\end{proposition}
A program analyzer which checks assertions by computing inductive invariants is
called an \emph{inductive} program analyzer.
Note that an inductive program analyzer need not give any information when an
assertion fails.
Indeed, most inductive program analyzers simply report false positives when
inductive invariants are too coarse.
%A \emph{program checker} is
%a program analyzer that returns an error trace when an assertion
%fails; an \emph{error trace} is a sequence of variable valuations from
%the program entry to the failed assertion. Rather than reporting false
%positives, program checkers have to return error traces to witness
%failed assertions. %Producing error traces (especially for recursive
%programs) complicates analysis algorithms. We hence consider a
%subclass of program checker.
A \emph{recursion-free inductive program analyzer} is a program analyzer that
checks recursion-free programs by computing inductive invariants.
Several recursion-free inductive program analyzers are available, such as
\textsc{CPAchecker}~\cite{BeyerK11}, \textsc{Blast}~\cite{BeyerHJM07},
\textsc{UFO}~\cite{AlbarghouthiLGC12}, \textsc{Astr\'ee}~\cite{CousotCFMMMR05},
etc.
Our goal is to check recursive programs by using a recursion-free inductive
program analyzer as a black box.
